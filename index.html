                                situation of COVID-19. The project builds a prototype 3D visualization of the subway system of the whole Shenzhen city.
                                And applied one-day subway data over the visualization. Try to help government decide the way to shut down stations to
                                best reduce the risk of spreading and don't affect the transportation much at the same time.
                                My job in the team is to do part of the data analysis part and the whole part of 3d visualization.

                                I'm currently just starting to work on this.
